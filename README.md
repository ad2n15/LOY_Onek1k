# LOY_OneK1K

This repository contains the complete pipeline used to identify and analyze mosaic loss of chromosome Y (LOY) in immune cells using single-cell RNA-seq data from the OneK1K study.

## üî¨ Project Overview

LOY is the most frequent somatic event in aging men and has been associated with increased risk for multiple age-related diseases. In this study, we utilized single-cell transcriptomic data (scRNA-seq) and SNP arrays genotyping to identify LOY at cellular resolution and explore its effects on immune cell phenotypes and gene expression programs.

## üõ†Ô∏è Required Packages & Tools

All analyses were performed using Apptainer containers on an HPC environment to ensure reproducibility.

### Processing scRNA-seq Reads & LOY Calling

- **Cell Ranger**: [10x Genomics Cell Ranger](https://www.10xgenomics.com/support/software/cell-ranger/downloads) ‚Äî for read alignment, quantification, and initial LOY calling.  
- **subset-bam**: [10x Genomics subset-bam](https://github.com/10XGenomics/subset-bam) ‚Äî for extracting specific cell barcodes from BAM files.  
- **Velocyto**: [genomicpariscentre/velocyto (Docker)](https://hub.docker.com/r/genomicpariscentre/velocyto) ‚Äî for spliced/unspliced read counting.
- **Python 3**: [jupyter/datascience-notebook (Docker)](https://hub.docker.com/r/jupyter/datascience-notebook/) ‚Äî for running Python scripts and analyses.

### Processing SNP Array Data & LOY Calling

- **BCFtools** ‚Äî for variant calling and manipulation.
- **MoChA**: [MoChA](https://github.com/freeseek/mocha) ‚Äî for detecting mosaic chromosomal alterations from SNP array data.
- **gtc2vcf**: [gtc2vcf](https://github.com/freeseek/gtc2vcf) ‚Äî for converting Illumina GTC files to VCF format.

### Downstream scRNA-seq Analysis

- **Custom Seurat v4 Container** ‚Äî available in the `make_container` folder, includes Seurat v4 and supporting R packages.
- **Seurat v5 (MAST DGE)**: [satijalab/seurat (Docker)](https://hub.docker.com/r/satijalab/seurat) ‚Äî for differential gene expression analysis using the MAST method.
- **phate**: [phate (PyPI)](https://pypi.org/project/phate/) ‚Äî for dimensionality reduction and visualization in Python.
