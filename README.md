# LOY_OneK1K

This repository contains the complete pipeline used to identify and analyze mosaic loss of chromosome Y (LOY) in immune cells using single-cell RNA-seq data from the OneK1K study.

## üî¨ Project Overview

LOY is the most frequent somatic event in aging men and has been associated with increased risk for multiple age-related diseases. In this study, we utilized single-cell transcriptomic data and SNP array genotyping to identify LOY at cellular resolution and explore its effects on immune cell phenotypes and gene expression programs.

Our integrated pipeline spans data preprocessing, LOY calling, and data harmonization across multiple platforms (Cell Ranger, Velocyto, SNP arrays), culminating in biological insights visualized through an interactive Shiny app.
