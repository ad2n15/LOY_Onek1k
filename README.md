# LOY_OneK1K

This repository contains the complete pipeline used to identify and analyze mosaic loss of chromosome Y (LOY) in immune cells using single-cell RNA-seq data from the OneK1K study.

## üî¨ Project Overview

LOY is the most frequent somatic event in aging men and has been associated with increased risk for multiple age-related diseases. In this study, we utilized single-cell transcriptomic data (scRNA-seq) and SNP arrays genotyping to identify LOY at cellular resolution and explore its effects on immune cell phenotypes and gene expression programs.
